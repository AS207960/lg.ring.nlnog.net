About the NLNOG Looking Glass
</h2>
This Looking Glass is hosted by <a href="https://nlnog.net">NLNOG</a>, The Dutch Network Operators Group. The Looking Glass runs <a href="http://openbgpd.org/">OpenBGPD</a> as backend and a custom made front end written by Teun Vink,
for which the source code can be found <a href="https://www.github.com/NLNOG/lg.ring.nlnog.net">on GitHub</a>. The code was inspired on <a href="https://github.com/sileht/bird-lg/">bird-lg</a> by Mehdi Abaakouk.
